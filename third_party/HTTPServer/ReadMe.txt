Quartz Composer Plugin

MiniSOAP					A Quartz Composer plug-in that sends a message to a 
						SOAP server and outputs the results.

Sample Requirements				The plugin was created using the Xcode editor running 
						under Mac OS X 10.6.x or later. 

About the sample				A Quartz Composer plug-in that performs a basic SOAP 
						server query in a background thread.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
						in /Developer/Applications. From the main menu, 
						choose "Project", set "Active Configuration" to "Release", 
						and "Active Target" to "Build & Copy".  These settings are
						also available from the top left corner of the 'Overview' 
						pull-down window. Build the project. Once the build has 
						completed successfully, the plug-in can be used as a 
						regular QC patch in the Quartz Composer editor (also 
						installed under /Developer/Applications), by selecting it 
						from the Library - Plugin panel.

						The patch requires a SOAP server URL and the message 
						that is going to be sent to the server. The processing 
						status and the result message will be produced.
